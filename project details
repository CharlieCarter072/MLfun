Project details:

input is 28*28 grid (784 values total) from a range of 0 to 1
vectors (lists) are vertical, matrices are vertical lists of horizontal weights

Matrix multiplication:
AxB * BxC = A*C where XxY and X is height, Y is width

[

structure:

Input layer (vector len 784)
Layer1Weights (matrix)


To Do:

develop network class
test layer class with data
start research on backprop. and gradient descent
make small scale savable data sets from total
